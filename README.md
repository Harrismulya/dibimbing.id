**Project Portofolio maching learning**

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. The data used is iris flower data obtained from scikit-learn. Iris data contains 4 features, namely sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), and petal width (cm). The purpose of this project is to classify targets.
this project uses a dataset which can be accessed through this link:https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html

**Project Overview**
This project is focused on using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify Iris on a set of features. The Iris dataset consists of data that classifies iris flowers into three types (classes) based on four features measured from the iris flower.The purpose of this project is to classify the targets consisting of setosa (0), versicolor (1), and virginica (3).
X: Features
Y: Target variabel (0,1,2)

**Goals** 
1. Studying the relationship between iris flower features and target classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) so that flowers can be classified based on new features that have never been seen before.
2. Visualize the decision boundary which shows how the model separates the feature space for various classes.

   **Conclusions**

   The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm successfully classifies the types of iris flowers based on their features with high accuracy. The model can represent good results and is an effective choice.
